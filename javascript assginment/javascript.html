Q-11: What are all the looping structures in JavaScript?
ANS:

    for loop: for loop provides a concise way of writing the loop structure. Unlike while loop, a for statement consumes the initialization, condition, and increment/decrement in one line thereby providing a shorter, easy-to-debug structure of looping. 

    for (initialization; testing condition; increment/decrement) {
        statement(s)
    }

    while loop: A while loop is a control flow statement that allows code to be executed repeatedly based on a given Boolean condition. The while loop can be thought of as a repeating if statement. 

    while (boolean condition) {
        loop statements...
    }

    do-while: The do-while loop is similar to the while loop with the only difference is that it checks for the condition after executing the statements, and therefore is an example of an Exit Control Loop. 

    do {
        Statements..
    }
    while (condition);

Q-17: What are the disadvantages of using innerHTML in JavaScript?
ANS:
    It is very slow because as inner HTML already parses the content even we have to parse the content again so that's why it takes time. When we have used the event handlers then the event handlers are not automatically attached to the new elements created by innerHTML.
